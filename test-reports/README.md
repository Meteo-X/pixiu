## Report Types

### Main Test Report (`test-report.md`)
- Executive summary of test results
- Overall PASS/FAIL status
- Critical findings and recommendations
- Test coverage summary

### Code Analysis (`code-analysis/`)
- **static-analysis.md**: Code quality, linting, type safety
- **security-scan.md**: Security vulnerabilities and best practices
- **performance-analysis.md**: Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### Integration Tests (`integration-tests/`)
- **component-integration.md**: Inter-component communication testing
- **system-integration.md**: End-to-end system behavior validation
- **api-testing.md**: Interface compliance and contract verification
- **environment-validation.md**: Configuration and deployment testing

### Acceptance Validation (`acceptance-validation/`)
- **requirements-check.md**: Requirements traceability and completion
- **user-story-validation.md**: Feature completeness against specifications
- **acceptance-criteria.md**: Detailed criteria verification
- **real-world-scenarios.md**: Practical usage pattern validation

### Recommendations (`recommendations/`)
- **fixes-needed.md**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **improvements.md**: Enhancement suggestions for better quality
- **next-steps.md**: Guidance for next development phases

## Usage

The `/test` command automatically creates these reports when testing specific tasks:

```bash
# Test a specific task
/test services/data-collection/exchange-collector/docs/implementation-plan.md 2.1

# This creates a new test session directory with timestamp
# All test results are organized and saved for future reference
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

1. **Before Task Completion**: Run `/test` to validate implementation
2. **Code Review Process**: Reference test reports during reviews
3. **Issue Resolution**: Use detailed reports to identify and fix problems
4. **Documentation**: Maintain testing history for project tracking
5. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure consistent quality standards across tasks

## Test Result Interpretation

### Status Indicators
- **PASS**: All acceptance criteria met, ready for completion
- **FAIL**: Critical issues found, requires fixes before completion
- **PARTIAL**: Some criteria met, minor issues or improvements needed

### Issue Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Blocks task completion, must be fixed
- **High**: Significant issues affecting functionality
- **Medium**: Quality or performance concerns
- **Low**: Minor improvements or suggestions

## Automated Testing Integration

Test reports can be integrated with:
- CI/CD pipelines for automated validation
- Code quality gates and checks
- Project management tools for tracking
- Documentation systems for knowledge sharing
